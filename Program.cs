            //TYpes of collections in C#
            //1. Arrays
            //2. Lists : it can store a collection of objects, similar to arrays but with dynamic size
            //3. Dictionaries : it can store key-value pairs ex Combination of a string and an integer ex <username,password>
            //4. HashSets : it can store unique values, similar to a set in mathematics
            //5. Queues : it can store a collection of objects in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order
            //6. Stacks : it can store a collection of objects in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order
            //7. LinkedLists : it can store a collection of objects in a linked list structure, where each object points to the next object in the list
            //8. SortedLists : it can store a collection of objects in a sorted order, similar to a dictionary but with sorted keys
            //9. SortedSets : it can store a collection of unique values in a sorted order, similar to a HashSet but with sorted values
            //10. Concurrent Collections : it can store a collection of objects that can be accessed by multiple threads simultaneously, such as ConcurrentDictionary, ConcurrentQueue, and ConcurrentBag

            //We can categoriese collections in C# into two main categories:
            //1. Generic Collections : These collections are type-safe and can store any type of object. They are defined in the System.Collections.Generic namespace.

            };
            HashSet<int> uniqueNumbers = new HashSet<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
            //2. Non-Generic Collections : These collections are not type-safe and can store any type of object. They are defined in the System.Collections namespace.
